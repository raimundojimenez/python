# Notice how if we have two print statements                
print "Hi"
print "there"

# The output will have each string on a separate line:                
Hi
there
                
# Now try ading a comma after the print statement:
print "Hi",
print "there"
                
# The output will place the subsequent string on the same line:
Hi there
